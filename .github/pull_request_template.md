## What is the purpose of the change

<!-- (For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).) -->

## Brief change log

<!-- *(for example:)*
- *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*
- *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*
- *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache* -->
